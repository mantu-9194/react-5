          <li>The Higher-Order component is simply called HOC.</li>
<li>A Higher-Order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component by adding additional functionalities to the component.
HOC is wrapped in the original component.</li>
<li>Higher-Order component is an advanced technique in ReactJS for reusing component logic.</li>
<li>HOCs are not part of the React API. But, It is a pattern that emerges from Reactâ€™s compositional nature.</li>
